        <h2>Programmer</h2>
        <p>I'm 22 years old, but I believe the age is nothing important. I'm crazy about making things and having crazy ideas. I'm consistently looking for new things to do, new challenges to deal with. Techcrunch and product hunt are my favourites daily reading! I believe startups are making crazy real and live incredible experiences. Who doesn't want to take risks, use our creativity and making your dream a reality? I want to places passion before profit, and try to combine personal interests and skills with the ability to earn a living.</p>

            <h3>The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand</h3>
            <p>This modern classic is the story of intransigent young architect Howard Roark, whose integrity was as unyielding as granite...of Dominique Francon, the exquisitely beautiful woman who loved Roark passionately, but married his worst enemy...and of the fanatic denunciation unleashed by an enraged society against a great creator. As fresh today as it was then, Rand’s provocative novel presents one of the most challenging ideas in all of fiction—that man’s ego is the fountainhead of human progress...</p>

            <h3>Tools of Titans by Timothy Ferriss</h3>
            <p>“For the last two years, I’ve interviewed more than 200 world-class performers for my podcast, The Tim Ferriss Show. The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it’s the first time they’ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview. This unusual depth has helped make The Tim Ferriss Show the first business/interview podcast to pass 100 million downloads.</p>
